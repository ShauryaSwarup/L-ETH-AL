### Working
The DApp involves two primary stakeholders: blue-collar workers and companies.

    The DApp facilitates daily job postings by companies, specifying job details and locations. Blue-collar workers, along with companies, connect their wallets to the portal. Companies post jobs with location and hourly salary. Workers browse available job listings and apply for jobs.

2. **Hiring Process**
   Workers are hired based on proximity to the job location and the number of vacancies available in First Come First Serve (FCFS) fashion.

4. **Automated Payment Processing**
   Upon check-out, payments are automatically transferred from the company's wallet to the worker's wallet based on the number of hours worked. 

5. **Reward System with NFTs**
   Workers are incentivized through a reward system where they earn non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on the number of hours worked which can redeemed to leverage social security.
